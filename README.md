This is a temporary fork, setup to speed up development of the wallening, a 2 year old project to resprite /tg/station's walls, windows, and wall hangings.

We run a modified version of pubby station 24/7, for the purposes of avoiding merge conflicts, and large scale map changes.
We will not be doing a full map pass until the project is more mature, and ready to be pr'd to master.

### What you should report

Pubby specific issues, missing sprites, fucked behavior, that sort of thing.
This codebase is very much still in beta right now, expect lots of missing stuff.

## Compilation

**The quick way**. Find `bin/server.cmd` in this folder and double click it to automatically build and host the server on port 1337.

**The long way**. Find `bin/build.cmd` in this folder, and double click it to initiate the build. It consists of multiple steps and might take around 1-5 minutes to compile. If it closes, it means it has finished its job. You can then [setup the server](.github/guides/RUNNING_A_SERVER.md) normally by opening `tgstation.dmb` in DreamDaemon.

**Building tgstation in DreamMaker directly is deprecated and might produce errors**, such as `'tgui.bundle.js': cannot find file`.
